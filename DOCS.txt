Instructions:

0. Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed.
1. Create a .moo file (one that tests basic functions is provided).
2. Run 'make filename.moo'.
3. The compiler will generate an executable in the project root.

Note: best results on Ubuntu probably (not tested on 
other operating systems), if a bunch of question marks
appear in your terminal we are sorry.
